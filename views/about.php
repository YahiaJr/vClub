                                A few clubs has a club system and web application for it .
                                It is found that many people suffer from going to the club to ask about the timetable
                                and reserve the activities in the club and also few people only know about the important
                                news such that competitions and trips because of that we make a web application
                                facilitates all of this .

                                has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown

                                survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
